# MenuTools

A set of simple UI tools for Unreal Engine, inspired by Lyra. The main citizen in this plugin is the UI manager, that manages a set of widget stacks from CommonUI.

# Attribution

This project contains some content from the Lyra example by Epic Games. All credits go to Epic Games for those assets.  

As far as I understand, we are allowed to use these assets in our Unreal Engine projects. If you are from Epic Games and 
think that it is not allowed to do so, please let me know and I will remove them from this repo.
